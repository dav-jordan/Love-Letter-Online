      <div>
        At the beginning of each turn, the player draws a card and picks a card
        in their hand to discard. Something different happens depending on the
        card discarded. The different cards as well as their effects and the
        amount in the deck can be found below. The goal is to either be the last
        player standing or have the highest value out of all other players when
        the deck runs out.
        Princess(1): Lose if discarded
        Countess(1): Discard if you have king or prince in your hand
        King(1): Trade hands with another player
        Prince(2): Make one player discard their hand
        Handmaid(2): Protection until your next turn
        Baron(2): Compare hands, lower hand is out
        Priest(2): Look at someone else's hand
        Guard(5): Guess someone's hand. If correct, they are out.
